## How to Use the YouTube View Generator?

1. **Provide Video URLs**:
   - Add the YouTube video URLs you want to generate views for in the input parameters.

2. **Adjust the Configuration**:
   - Optionally configure the number of views or playback duration for each video.

3. **Run the Tool**:
   - The generator will automatically create traffic to these videos by simulating user interactions, such as playing the video for a specified duration.

## How Does It Work?

- **Simulated Views**:
  - The generator opens each video in a browser and plays it for a specified amount of time to simulate a view. The default playback duration is around 30 seconds.
  
- **Browser-Based Simulation**:
  - Views are generated using a headless browser or a visible browser to mimic real user behavior.

- **Proxy Support**:
  - To ensure anonymity, the tool uses proxies based on the provided country code.

## Important Notes
- **View Count Update**:
  - Views may take up to 24 hours to reflect in YouTube's statistics.

- **Legitimacy**:
  - YouTube might filter out views that appear artificial or illegitimate, especially if a large number of views are generated in a short period.
